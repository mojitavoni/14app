# How to Build and Use as Default DevContainer in VS Code

## 🎯 Goal
Make this **Minimal Developer Environment - DataOps** your default devcontainer that you can reuse across projects.

## 📋 Option 1: Use as Docker Image (Recommended for Reuse)

### Step 1: Build Docker Image

```bash

1. **Dockerfile** - For building standalone image
2. **docker-compose.yml** - For easy local development
3. **Template devcontainer** - For reusing in other projects
4. **VS Code settings** - Make it your default

Let's start!
